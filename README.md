# Azure-react-nest-social-media
The goal of this school project is to create a social network enabling users to post content. Users will have to authenticate themselves using Azure auth or manually ( login and psw) and they will be able to perform a "CRUD" on the various elements of the web application. We used React and Nest for coding and Azure services for deployment.
These are the Azure services used:
- App Service â€“ Web App : contains the website
- Function App : for APi
- Azure Cosmos DB : as DB
- Azure Blob Storage : to stock media
- API Management Service : to publish and manage api administration
- Azure Key Vault : to secure and control the app
- Azure AD B2C : to manage authentification
