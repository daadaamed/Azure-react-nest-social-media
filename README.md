# Azure-react-nest-social-media
The goal of this school project is to create a social network enabling users to post content. Users will have to authenticate themselves using Azure auth or manually ( login and psw) and they will be able to perform a "CRUD" on the various elements of the web application. We used React and Nest for coding and Azure services for deployment.
